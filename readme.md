# Elusive Love Button

## üåü Description

Welcome to Elusive Love Button! This is a fun and interactive web page initially inspired by a "Do you love me?" prompt, which evolved to feature playful buttons with dynamic and elusive behaviors. It showcases how simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery) can create engaging user interactions.

The core idea is a prompt with a "Yes" button leading to a happy outcome, and a "No" button that tries to evade clicks by moving randomly. It might also include features like multi-click sequences on buttons, triggering different actions before becoming elusive.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive "Yes" Sequence:** Clicking "Yes" triggers a loading animation followed by a celebratory GIF.
* **Elusive "No" Button:** The "No" button playfully moves to a random position on the screen when hovered over or clicked, making it a challenge to press.
* **Multi-Action Clicks:** One or more buttons might perform different actions based on the number of times they are clicked, culminating in an elusive behavior.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a good experience on desktop and mobile.
* **Dynamic Content Display:** Elements are shown and hidden dynamically to create a sequence of interactions.
