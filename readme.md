# 🎉 Elusive Love Button ❤️

**A playful, interactive web experience that asks the ultimate question with a twist!**

---

## 🌟 Description

Welcome to **Elusive Love Button**! This project transforms a simple "Do you love me?" question into a delightful and highly interactive web page. It's a showcase of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a touch of jQuery and fun libraries) can create truly engaging user experiences.

The heart of the game is a choice: clicking the "Yes" button unleashes a joyous, confetti-filled celebration. Dare to click "No"? Prepare for a mischievous button that changes its tune before cheekily darting around your screen, trying to evade your cursor! A handy "Go Back" option lets you relive the fun from the start.
